          <p> This is a typographic book that I made to match the lyrics to <em>Tell Me Why</em> by Penpals. It's a great song with an amazing video which perfectly captures the lyrics of the song as well as one of <b>THE</b> guitar riffs of all time. It was rather difficult trying to figure out how I wanted to lay things out on each page of the book, but thankfully the song is really <i>weird</i> so I felt less restrictions on how I layed things out</p>
          <img src="/img/Type Specimen Poster-1.png" alt="type specimen poster" class="feature">
          <p> This is a type specimen poster I made for the typeface <i>Skia</i>. The hardest part of trying to create the poster was not the technical elements, or that I was limited to using Skia. Rather, the hard part was trying to figure out how to balence things out. Admittidly, it's something I struggle with across all of my projects, but I'd say here I managed to find a reasonable solution.</p>
