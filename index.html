        <p>My name is <b>Grant Young</b> and I am a student in the Creative Technology and design program at CU Boulder. If you're not from Colorado, I'm from Denver Colorado, and if you are from Colorado, I'm from Littleton, Colorado. I am the youngest of three siblings. My interests lie in project-based work, such as graphic design, web development, game development, and other personal projects such as video editing. I tend to get hyper fixated on tasks which is good especially when working on projects where there is a "clear" end goal as opposed to doing something infinently repeatable day-in and day-out. Outside of project-based work, I also have interests in video games, graphic novels and manga, collecting, drawing, and in writing and creating stories.</p>
