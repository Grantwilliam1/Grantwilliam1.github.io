          <p> This is <i>One Piece</i> which is a series I like very, very much. This series has inspired in many different ways, but the main way is because it has inspired me to create. This is that type of series which has triggered a pavlovian response in me to where, whenever I read or watch it, I get the incessant urge to just make something</p>
          <img src="/img/Stone.jpg" alt="Dr Stone" class="feature2">
          <p> This is <i>Dr Stone</i> which is illustrated by Boichi. I would easily say that he's my favorite manga artist of all time and motivates me to improve my art</p>
          <img src="/img/persona5.png" alt="Persona 5" class="feature2">
          <p> This is <i>Persona 5</i> which is my favorite game of all time (<i>Persona 5 Royal</i> is the better version, I just have nostalgia for this version). I would say that this game is the main reason why I love video games so much. Great style, great gameplay, great art, great characters, great story, basicially the complete package. Essentially, this game is what really made me want to work in the games industry (and embarrassingly, I really hope one day I can do work on the Persona franchise)</p>
          <img src="/img/smash.jpeg" alt="Super Smash Bros Ultimate" class="feature2">
          <p> This is <i>Super Smash Bros Ultimate<i> is a game that I hold very close to me. Admittedly, it's not my favorite game (I mean, I just admitted to <i>Persona 5</i> being my favorite game of all time). Rather, what I love about this game Is it's sense of community and how it imbodies what makes people fall in love with gaming. It was always such a special treat seeing each character reveal and collectively rioting when they added another <i>Fire Emblem</i> character. Admittedly, the Smash Bros fandom can easily be ranked with <i>Overwatch</i> and <i>Team Fortress 2<i> in terms of toxic fandoms (still better than <i>League of Legends</i> at the very least), but that sense of a community coming together to spill their love for video games is a magical thing and really made me want to be part of the video game communities (this game is also the reason why I wasted my life saving on plastic figurines of each of the game's playable characters and will continue to do so for the unreleased figures).</p>
