          <p> This is a typographic book that I made to match the lyrics to <em>Tell Me Why</em> by Penpals. It's a great song with an amazing video which perfectly captures the lyrics of the song as well as one of <b>THE</b> guitar riffs of all time. It was rather difficult trying to figure out how I wanted to lay things out on each page of the book, but thankfully the song is really <i>weird</i> so I felt less restrictions on how I layed things out</p>

          <p> This is a type specimen poster I made for the typeface <i>Skia</i>. The hardest part of trying to create the poster was not the technical elements, or that I was limited to using Skia. Rather, the hard part was trying to figure out how to balence things out. Admittidly, it's something I struggle with across all of my projects, but I'd say here I managed to find a reasonable solution.</p>

          <p> This is a poster mailer that I made for the Colorado Symphony. Not gonna lie, this was kind of a pain. It's one think to know what you need to do to make something look good. It's another thing to make the thing. However, for as much as I complain, I feel making this mailer was good experience in not only closing the gap between knowledge and skill, but also defining my overall style for making stuff (though I still have to complain about the obsurd amount of meaningless text that I needed to though in here</p>
