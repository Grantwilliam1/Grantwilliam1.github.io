      <h4 id="amphietext1">I had a hard time coming up with a 5th page, but then I thought to myself, "The current theme of this website is that I'm talking about myself, so why not break down the things I'm oddly passionate about?"</h4>

          <p id="amphietext2">Out of every pokemon that exists, for whatever reason, ampharos is my favorite pokemon out of every single one. I could give an oddly in depth analysis analysis as the the specific reasons WHY Ampharos is the best pokemon, but if you click on the Ampharos plushie at the very top of the screen, you'll understand why I'm obsessed with this dope. Just know that this pokemon is one of the things that defines my personally and, honestly, I feel it's one of the better things to base my personality off of</p>

          <p id="amphietext3">Speaking of a part of my personality, It's undeniable that I am what most people call a "Kirby Fanatic". I've played all the games, I collect Kirby Plushies, I repeatedly talk the ears off of random people who made the mistake of engaging in conversation with me (some who didn't). However, even with all that, I'm not even the biggest Kirby fan I know personally :,)</p>

          <p id="amphietext4">Look man, it's probably best to keep this short because I have by far the most to say about this series right here. Just know that I will tell you everything about this series if you even bring it up with me. That's your warning</p>
